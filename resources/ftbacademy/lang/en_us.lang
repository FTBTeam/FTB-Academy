academy.welcome.reward=Read School tutorial

academy.introJEI.title=Item and Recipe Searching
academy.introJEI.desc=Learn to use JEI
academy.introJEI.text1=Modded Minecraft has a lot of new blocks and items, so it's hard to remember all the crafting recipes. Luckily, the mod "Just Enough Items" will help make that easier!
academy.introJEI.text2=On the right side of the inventory is a list of every block and item in the modpack. Hovering over one and hitting R will show you its recipe, and hitting U will show what recipes use it.
academy.introJEI.text3=At the bottom of the inventory is a search bar, where you can type in the name of an item to filter the item list.
academy.introJEI.text4=You can double click the search bar to search for that item in your inventory.
academy.introJEI.reward=Read JEI tutorial

academy.introstorage.title=Introduction to Storage

academy.introstorage.task=Enter the storage room

academy.introgenstorage.title=General Storage
academy.introgenstorage.desc=Open Chests and Storage Crates
academy.introgenstorage.text1=Iron Chests and Storage Crates are good for storing a large amount of items. They work just like regular chests, but they store a lot more.
academy.introgenstorage.text2=They both come in tiers, with more expensive tiers storing more.
academy.introgenstorage.task1=Open Iron Chest
academy.introgenstorage.task2=Open Diamond Chest
academy.introgenstorage.task3=Open Small Storage Chest

academy.introdigitalstorage.text1=Refined Storage allows you to store a massive amount of a variety of items.
academy.introdigitalstorage.text2=Items are stored in Disks, which themselves are stored in Disk Drives. You can access items in Disks by opening the Grid.
academy.introdigitalstorage.text3=Instead of being limited by the amount of slots an inventory has, digitally stored items only depend on the size of the Disk used.
academy.introdigitalstorage.text4=The last quest gave you a Storage Disk. Open the Disk Drive and insert the Storage Disk, and then open the Grid and take out the Water Bucket inside.
academy.introdigitalstorage.task1=Open Disk Drive
academy.introdigitalstorage.task2=Open Crafting Grid

academy.introfluidstorage.title=Fluid Storage
academy.introfluidstorage.desc=Empty a Bucket of Water
academy.introfluidstorage.text1=Like there are mods that add ways to store items, there are also mods that add ways to store fluids.
academy.introfluidstorage.text2=Blocks that store fluids usually have the word Tank in the name, so you can just search for "Tank" in JEI to find them all.
academy.introfluidstorage.text3=The Portable Tank has multiple tiers which allow them to store more fluid.
academy.introfluidstorage.text4=Right click the Portable Tank on the left to take out some Water, and then right click on the one on the right to fill it.

academy.introautomation.title=Introduction to Automation
academy.introautomation.desc=Learn about Automation
academy.introautomation.text1=Simply storing items and fluids is not enough, to properly automate you have to move them around automatically.
academy.introautomation.text2=The simplest way to move things around is Ducts. Items are moved through Itemducts and fluids are moved through Fluiducts.
academy.introautomation.text3=Servos are used to pull from blocks, and items/fluids will automatically go into the nearest block that can store them.
academy.introautomation.task=Enter the automation room

academy.introfilters.title=Filtering
academy.introfilters.desc=Set some Filters
academy.introfilters.text1=Filters can be used to specify what is allowed to enter a block through the Duct. You can open it up to set its Whitelist or Blacklist.

academy.introfluidtransfer.text3=You can set Servos to function when they don't have a Redstone signal by opening it and pressing the Redstone Dust button on the right. Do this here and set the Servo to either Ignore Redstone or Low (which means no signal).

academy.introtech.title=Introduction to Technology
academy.introtech.desc=Learn about technology
academy.introtech.text1=Technology mods play a large part in FTB modpacks. These quests are dedicated to teaching you the basics.
academy.introtech.task=Enter the technology room

academy.introgen.title=Making Energy
academy.introgen.desc=Use a Coal Generator
academy.introgen.text1=Most technology mods use RF, which is essentially just electricity.
academy.introgen.text2=Generators are machines that make RF. The Coal Generator uses furnace fuel, such as Coal, to generate RF.
academy.introgen.text3=Place the Coal Generator down on the Block of Iron and give it some Coal to make it generate RF.
academy.introgen.task=Place generator on the iron block

academy.intropowertransfer.title=Moving Energy
academy.intropowertransfer.desc=Place Fluxducts

academy.intropowertransfer.text3=Place the Fluxducts down on the Wool.
academy.intropowertransfer.task=Place the Fluxducts on the Magenta Wool

academy.intromachines.title=Using Energy
academy.intromachines.desc=Use a Redstone Furnace
academy.intromachines.text1=Generators make energy, but you also have to use it. There are plenty of machines that use RF to perform a variety of functions.
academy.intromachines.text2=The Redstone Furnace in particular uses RF to smelt items. It functions almost exactly like a regular Furnace, except it runs on RF instead of Coal.
academy.intromachines.text3=Place the Redstone Furnace on the Block of Lapis Lazuli and use it to smelt some Pulverized Iron.
academy.intromachines.task=Place the Redstone Furnace on the Block of Lapis Lazuli

academy.introenergystorage.title=Storing Energy
academy.introenergystorage.desc=Place and configure an Energy Cell
academy.introenergystorage.text1=Energy Cells store RF. It is best to have them between your generators and machines so the machines have a buffer of energy they can use.
academy.introenergystorage.text2=Sneak right click the Crescent Hammer on the middle Fluxduct block to break it, and then place the Energy Cell down instead.
academy.introenergystorage.text3=Open the Energy Cell and click the blue gear button on the right to configure it. There, you can choose which sides are input and which sides are output.
academy.introenergystorage.text4=Click on the face to toggle between input (blue), output (red), and neither (yellow). You can hold sneak and left click on the front face to set them all to off. Set this one so that it inputs from the generator and ouputs towards the Redstone Furnace.
academy.introenergystorage.task=Replace the middle Fluxduct with an Energy Cell and configure it

academy.introstarlight.text3=Place the Crafting Table on the Wool block near the Floating Crystal and craft the Resonating Wand in it. You can see the Resonating Wand's recipe by searching for it in JEI, or by clicking the Resonating Wand in the Tasks section of this menu.

academy.introlct.title=Collecting Starlight
academy.introlct.desc=Make a Luminous Crafting Table
academy.introlct.text1=The Luminous Crafting Table allows you to get Starlight just from being able to see the night sky, though it will also be powered by a Floating Crystal if one is available.

academy.introlct.text3=If the Luminous Crafting Table has the items and Starlight required, right click it with a Resonating Wand to craft the item.

academy.introilumpowder.title=Crafting Items with Starlight
academy.introilumpowder.desc=Make Illumination Powder
academy.introilumpowder.text1=Illumination Powder is just one of the many items you can make with Starlight. You can place it down anywhere and it will act as a light source, and it doesn't take up a block space.

academy.intromanagen.title=Generating Mana
academy.intromanagen.desc=Make an Endoflame
academy.intromanagen.text1=Magical flowers are created in the Petal Apothecary. Fill it with Water using a Water Bucket, make and then throw in the petals according to the Endoflame's crafting recipe, and then throw in a seed to craft the flower.
academy.intromanagen.text2=You can either throw items at the Petal Apothecary or right click with the Petal in hand to place it inside. You can hold sneak and then right click with an empty hand to take the last item back out.
academy.intromanagen.text3=The Endoflame generates Mana when a burnable item is thrown on the ground next to it. If it is placed near a Mana Spreader, the Mana will move to it.
academy.intromanagen.text4=Once you've made the Endoflame, place it on the lightest Grass Block. Throw some Coal nearby and it will begin to generate Mana.

academy.intromanasteel.title=Crafting with Mana
academy.intromanasteel.desc=Make some Manasteel

academy.introelementium.title=Elven Trading
academy.introelementium.desc=Get some Elementium
