# Better Builder's Wands

Better Builder's Wands adds several tools to allow you to place blocks easier. Higher tiers can place more blocks simultaneously as well as place them in more places.
Wands can only place the block of the surface they are being used on. That means if you click them on Sand they will place Sand. This makes them good for extending surfaces or filling holes.
