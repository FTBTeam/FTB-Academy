#Templates
Templates allow you to save copied structures into items, so you can save them to paste them more later.

Place the Gadget in the left slot and Paper or a Template in the right slot.
Click Save to write the structure data in the Gadget to the Paper, creating a Template. You an also overwrite Templates instead of using Paper.
Click Load to write the structure data in the Template to the Gadget, allowing you to paste it into the world.

Click Copy to copy the structure data in the Gadget to your computer's clipboard. You can post this online or send it to someone out of the game and they can load it.
Click Paste to paste the structure data from your computer's clipboard to the Paper or Template in the right slot, so you can load it into the Gadget.

[You can also find user-made structures online here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/9x9/)
Explore that page and find a structure you like and open the post it's in. The post should have a link pastebin.com, and at the bottom should be a text box that says "RAW Paste Data." Select everything in the box and copy it.
