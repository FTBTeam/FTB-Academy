# Commands

These commands are just useful for general play. These commands may be disabled depending on the server, or you may need special permissions (or cheats enabled if in single player) to use them.

"/back" will teleport you to where you last died, but only once per life.

"/tpa [player]" will request to teleport yourself to that player, and if they accept you will be teleported to them.

"/sethome [name]" will set the point you are standing on as a home of that name, and "/home [name]" will teleport you there from anywhere else. Every player has their own homes and cannot teleport to each other's.

"/setwarp [name]" and "/warp [name]" work like homes, except everyone can teleport warps.

"/shrug" will display "¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯" in chat, which is extremely useful.

"/nick [nickname]" will change your username to the nickname in chat. "/nick" by itself will reset it to your actual username.

"/cofh tps" will show you the ticks per second in each dimension. 20 TPS is optimal, and the lower that value is, the laggier that dimension will be.

"/cofh friend gui" will open the GUI for Thermal Expansion friends, which are used in conjunction with Signalum Security Locks to allow players on the list to access locked machines. You can also use "/cofh friend add [player]" or "/cofh friend remove [player]" to do it directly from chat.
