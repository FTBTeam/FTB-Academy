# Glossary of Important Terms

A modpack is a prebuilt collection of mods. Different modpacks can have different mods or have something special about them.

A kitchen sink modpack is just a bunch of mods thrown together with no major gameplay changes. The name comes from the phrase "everything but the kitchen sink."

An expert modpack has been configured to be harder in some way. Usually this is done by changing the recipes for items so you have to go through a longer, more difficult progression.

RF (Redstone Flux) and FE (Forge Energy) are the most common names for the universal energy system used by most technology mods. They are interchangable, along with Î¼I (microinfinity) from EnderIO which is not in this modpack. RF transfer is usually measured in RF/t (RF per tick)

A chunk is a 16 wide and 16 long segment of blocks reaching from the very bottom to the very top of the world. You can hold F3 and tap G to see the boundaries of chunks.

Ticks are the rate that the game runs. Optimally, a tick is 1/20th of a second. Lag can cause this to increase, lowering the tick rate. You can use the command "/forge tps" to see the current tick rate of each dimension.
