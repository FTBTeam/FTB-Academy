#FTB mods

Everything in the top left corner is added by FTB mods, like FTB Utilities, FTB Quests, and FTB Guides. Some buttons are only available when you are in a world with cheats enabled, or are OP on a server.

![](claimedchunks.png)
This button opens a map where you can claim chunks for your team. Left click to claim a chunk for your team, right click claimed chunks to unclaim them. Only members or allies of the team can interact with things in claimed chunks. You can hold shift and left click claimed chunks to make them permanently chunkloaded, so that chunk won't unload when nobody is nearby.
