#Trees
Starting with the most obvious change, this modpack uses the mod Dynamic Trees. Instead of trees just being like every other block, they dynamically grow up from being a sapling to being fully grown!

Breaking a log block will also break every log above it, tipping it over until it hits the ground and drops as items. It takes longer to chop thicker trees than thin ones, so it's smart to invest in an Axe. Branches and thin logs will drop sticks instead of wood blocks.
You can also chop off the branches first to make it quicker to chop the main tree.

Instead of Saplings, trees will drop Acorns or Seeds which function virtually identically to Saplings, but grow over time instead of instantly. You can still use Bone Meal to speed it up, which will progress the tree in stages instead of having a chance of growing it all at once.

![Dirt Bucket](item:dynamictrees:dirtbucket)
Some things don't work with Dynamic Trees saplings or trees, so you can craft a Dynamic Trees sapling with a Bucket of Dirt to create a vanilla sapling, which will grow a vanilla tree.
