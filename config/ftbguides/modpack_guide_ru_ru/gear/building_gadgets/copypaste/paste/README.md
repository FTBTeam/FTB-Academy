#Construction Paste
Construction Paste can take the appearance of any block, but it won't mimic any special features about it. Gadgets will use Construction Paste from your inventory if they do not have enough of the actual block.

To get Construction Paste, place Construction Powder next to water and then break the resulting block. You can store it in a Paste Container by right clicking it while you have Paste in your inventory.

When placed, it will start out as Construction Blocks and slowly transition to looking like the block. Even if it resembles a soft block, it needs a pickaxe to mine.
