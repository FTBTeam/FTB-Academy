![Copy-Paste Gadget](item:buildinggadgets:copypastetool)
The Copy-Paste Gadget will allow you to copy an area and place it somewhere else, without destroying the original. You can also place structures other people have made online!

Right click on one corner of the area you want to copy. This block is where it will be placed from later on. Sneak right click on the other corner to copy the rectangular area between them.

Hold G then change to Paste mode, and you will see a hologram of the blocks you copied. You can anchor it somewhere and then hold sneak and right click to adjust the structure's location manually, if it's off at all.

You can save structures to Templates.
If you don't want to have to get all the blocks for your structure, you can use Construction Paste instead!
