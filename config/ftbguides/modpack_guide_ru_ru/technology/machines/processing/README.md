# Ore Processing

Most tech mods add a way to turn one ore into multiple ingots. This is usually done by grinding an ore into 2 dusts, and then smelting each dust into an ingot.

[The first way to double ores you'll probably have access to is the Smeltery from Tinkers' Construct. Click here to open its page in the guide.](guide:/modpack/gear/tinkers_construct/smeltery/)

## Ore Doubling
As for actual technological ways to do it, in that they require RF, you can try Thermal Expansion's Pulverizer or Actually Addition's Crusher and Double Crusher.

![Pulverizer](item:thermalexpansion:machine 1 1)

![](crusher.png)
The Crusher has a chance of creating a secondary output when processing materials.
![](double_crusher.png)
The Double Crusher works the same, but has 2 inputs. You can set it so that it automatically splits items over both inputs so it effectively works twice as fast.

The Pulverizer also has a chance of creating a secondary output. It can be upgraded and augmented to work much faster and produce more secondary materials.
![Augment: Tectonic Initiator](item:thermalexpansion:augment 1 273)
You can install the Augment: Tectonic Initiator to the Pulverizer and it will give an additional ore output at the additional cost of Tectonic Petrotheum.

## Smelting
Now that you have a way to double ores into dusts, you just have to smelt them. You could get away with using a regular stone Furnace, but that's boring! There are plenty of machines that can smelt using RF.
![Powered Furnace](item:actuallyadditions:block\_furnace\_double)
![Redstone Furnace](item:thermalexpansion:machine)
![Resourceful Furnace](item:industrialforegoing:resourceful_furnace)

![](powered_furnace.png)
The Powered Furnace can smelt 2 items at the same time. You can set it to split the contents over both inputs so it effectively smelts twice as fast.
![](resourceful_furnace.png)
The Resourceful Furnace has three input slots and produces a small amount of Essence (which can be turned into experience) when used.
![](redstone_furnace.png)
The Redstone Furnace has one input but can be upgraded and augmented to work faster.
![Augment: Flux Anodizers](item:thermalexpansion:augment 1 257)
You can install the Augment: Flux Anodizers to the Redstone Furnace and it will give an additional ore output in one step instead of having to grind it first. However, the Redstone Furnace will only be able to smelt ores while the Augment is installed.
