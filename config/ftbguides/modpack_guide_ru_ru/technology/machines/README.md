#Machines

Now that we have ways of generating and moving RF, we need things to use it!
Machines always serve some function, and are generally powered by RF. They can do things like automatically mine blocks, process materials, store and automatically craft items, and much more.

Thermal Expansion machines come in tiers. Higher tiers work faster and have slots for more Augments. To increase the tier of a machine, right click it with an Upgrade Kit of the next tier, or a Conversion Kit of the tier you want to jump to. The tiers in order are as follows:
•Basic
•Hardened
•Reinforced
•Signalum
•Resonant

Thermal Expansion machines allow you to automatically pull and push from adjacent inventories on certain sides of the block. For instance, you can make it automatically pull from an inventory above it, and then automatically push the output to the right. To do this, open the Configuration button in the machine's inventory. Each slot is color coded.

Clicking the side of the block will change what slot it will be set to. In the above picture, items will be input from the top, the main output will exit from the right, and the secondary output will exit from the left.
You can click the orange and blue arrows to toggle if the machine will automatically export and important items. If disabled, you will have to pipe them in and out; if enabled, they will pull and push by themselves.
