# Tool Upgrading

Draconic Evolution tools, weapons, and armor can be upgraded with Fusion Crafting. This uses Upgrade Keys.
![Upgrade Key (RF Capacity)](item:draconicevolution:tool_upgrade)

Upgrades are applied in tiers:
Basic
Wyvern
Draconic
Chaotic

You have to apply the upgrades in order; you can't give it a Draconic tier upgrade unless it already has Basic and Wyvern upgrades.

Hit U while hovering over the Upgrade Key to see its crafting uses. To install the Upgrade Key into the tool, just follow the fusion crafting recipe for that tier.

The Upgrade Key does not get destroyed when used, so you will only ever need to make one of each Key.
