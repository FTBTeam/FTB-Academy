# Machine Crafting

![Compactor](item:thermalexpansion:machine 1 5)
The Compactor allows you to squish ingots into plates, and Blaze Dust into Blaze Rods.

![Centrifugal Separator](item:thermalexpansion:machine 1 10)
The Centrifugal Separator allows you to un-combine items and blocks, getting back their components.

![Sequential Fabricator](item:thermalexpansion:machine 1 11)
The Sequential Fabricator allows you to set a crafting recipe and then have it automatically craft it whenever it has the required items in its inventory.

![Alchemical Imbuer](item:thermalexpansion:machine 1 12)
The Alchemical Imbuer combines fluids and items to create potions. The potions it creates are fluids, and you will have to send them to a Fluid Transposer to put them into bottles.
If you want to create more complex potions, it would be best to place multiple Alchemical Imbuers in series.

![Arcane Ensorcellator](item:thermalexpansion:machine 1 13)
The Arcane Ensorcellator uses Essence of Knowledge and an item to enchant books. You can use this to get pretty much any enchantment in the modpack.
