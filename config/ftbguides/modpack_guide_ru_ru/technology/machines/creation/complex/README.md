# Fluid Crafting

Some recipes require fluids to be crafted. To do this, you need a Magma Crucible and a Fluid Transposer.

The Magma Crucible is a machine that melts blocks and items into fluids. This is especially useful to turn metals into molten metals, and stone into Lava.

The Fluid Transposer moves fluids into or out of items. This can fill and empty buckets as well as craft certain items, like Fluxducts.
