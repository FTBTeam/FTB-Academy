# Resource Creation

Some resources cannot be found in the world and have to be created.

## Simple Alloys
![Electrum Ingot](item:thermalfoundation:material 1 161)
Simple alloys like Electrum and Invar can be made just by pulverizing ingots and then combining the dusts.
[You can also make most alloys in the Smeltery.](../../../../gear/tinkers_construct/smeltery/)

## Fluid Crafting
![Enderium Ingot](item:thermalfoundation:material 1 167)
Some items require fluids to be crafted. This is done using a combination of the Magma Crucible and the Fluid Transposer.

## Atomic Reconstructor
![Void Crystal](item:actuallyadditions:item_crystal 1 3)
The Atomic Reconstructor is used to create Crystals, as well as some other items.

## Empowerer
![Empowered Enori Crystal](item:actuallyadditions:item\_crystal\_empowered 1 5)
The Empowerer is a multiblock machine that is used to enhance certain items.
