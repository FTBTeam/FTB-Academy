# Atomic Reconstructor

![Atomic Reconstructor](item:actuallyadditions:block\_atomic\_reconstructor)
The Atomic Reconstructor uses RF to turn items into other items.
This is mainly used to make various Crystals, which are a crafting component to a lot of machines.
It also has several other uses, like turning Sand into Soul Sand or Nether Quartz into Prismarine. Hit U while hovering over the item to see all of its uses.

The Atomic Reconstructor works by shooting out a laser, which converts items in an area around where it hits.
By default, it will shoot whenever it has power. You can right click it with a Redstone Torch to make it work only when given a Redstone pulse.
![This is a good setup for automating it, as the pressure plate will trigger it and the laser will stop when it hits the pressure plate](atomic_reconstructor.png)

![Lens](item:actuallyadditions:item_misc 1 18)
You can attach Lenses to the Atomic Reconstructor to change how it works. Lenses can make the laser explode, kill mobs, color blocks, move enchantments from items to books, and generate ores.
