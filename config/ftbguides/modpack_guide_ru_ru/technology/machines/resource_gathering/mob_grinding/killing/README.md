# Mob Killing

Now that you've automated mob spawning, you have to also automate mob killing.

![Spikes](item:mob\_grinding\_utils:spikes)
Spikes will slowly damage and kill any mob that touches it. Mobs will drop experience but not player-only drops like Blaze Rods.

![Mob Masher](item:mob\_grinding\_utils:saw)
The Mob Masher will damage mobs that touch it when given a Redstone signal. It has slots for Mob Masher Upgrades. Fully upgraded, the Mob Masher essentially has Sharpness X, Looting X, and Beheading X.

![Grinder](item:draconicevolution:grinder)
Draconic Evolution's Mob Grinder uses RF to instantly kill all mobs in an area in front of it, including the Wither. It drops player-only drops.

![Mob Crusher](item:industrialforegoing:mob_relocator)
The Mob Crusher will kill mobs in its working area, providing player-only drops. Items are picked up into its internal inventory, and experience is picked up and converted to Essence, which can be used to spawn mobs in the Mob Duplicator.
Its default working area is 1x1, so you need to install a Range Addon if you want to increase its range.

![Mob Slaughter Factory](item:industrialforegoing:mob\_slaughter\_factory)
The Mob Slaughter Factory will kill mobs in its working area. However, instead of dropping their items or experience, it will instead generate Liquid Meat in its internal tank. It also has a small chance of generating Pink Slime.
