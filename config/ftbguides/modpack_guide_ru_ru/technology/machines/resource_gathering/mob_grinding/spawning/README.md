# Mob Spawning

In order to automatically kill mobs, you have to automatically spawn mobs. While you *could* get away with just having a dark room, that's very inefficient. These blocks and items will help automate mob spawning.

![Stabilized Mob Spawner](item:draconicevolution:draconic_spawner)
If you use a Core from Draconic Evolution on a Mob Spawner, it will pop out as an item and turn into a Stabilized Mob Spawner.
More expensive Cores will create better Stabilized Mob Spawners that can spawn more mobs at a time and more often and decreases the requirements for mobs to spawn (low tier spawners need grass for passive mobs and darkness for hostile mobs, and high tier spawners don't need the player to be nearby).
A Redstone signal will pause the Stabilized Mob Spawner.

![Mob Soul](item:draconicevolution:mob_soul 1 0 {EntityName:"[Random-Display]"})
Mob Souls have a chance of dropping when you kill a mob with a Draconic Evolution weapon or a weapon enchanted with Reaper.
Right clicking a Stabilized Mob Spawner with a Mob Soul will set it to spawn that mob.

![Spawner Changer](item:actuallyadditions:item\_spawner\_changer)
Right click on a mob with the Spawner Changer to set it to that mob, killing it in the process. Then use the Spawner Changer on a Mob Spawner, and it will change to spawn the mob the Spawner Changer is set to. The Spawner Changer is destroyed in the process.
If you don't have any Mob Souls, you can use this to set Mob Spawners before Stabilizing them.

![Mob Swab](item:mob\_grinding\_utils:mob\_swab)
You can right click on a mob with a Mob Swab to collect its DNA, then craft it with an XP Bucket and some Seeds to get GM Chicken Feed. Feed that to a Chicken, and it will blow up and create a Spawn Egg for that mob. You can right click it on the ground to spawn it like normal, or you can right click it on a Mob Spawner to change it to spawn that mob.
This also works great with Stabilized Mob Spawners.

![Mob Imprisonment Tool](item:industrialforegoing:mob\_imprisonment\_tool)
Right click a mob with a Mob Imprisonment Tool to catch it, storing it in the item. You can right click it again anywhere else to place the mob exactly as it was.
![Mob Duplicator](item:industrialforegoing:mob_duplicator)
The Mob Duplicator uses Essence (which you get from the Mob Crushers) and RF to spawn the mob that the Mob Imprisonment Tool inside it is set to. It will stop if there are too many nearby.
