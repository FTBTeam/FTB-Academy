![Pitiful Fuel Generator](item:industrialforegoing:pitiful\_fuel\_generator)
The Pitiful Fuel Generator is extremely cheap. It can only burn wooden items, and generates 11,250 RF per item at 15 RF/t (for Planks and Logs, Sticks and Slabs make less).

![Petrified Fuel Generator](item:industrialforegoing:petrified\_fuel\_generator)
The Petrified Fuel Generator can burn any furnace fuel. 1 Coal generates 60,000 RF at 80 RF/t.

![Biofuel Generator](item:industrialforegoing:biofuel_generator)
The Biofuel Generator generates RF using Biofuel, which is made in the Bioreactor. The Bioreactor uses RF and plant matter to generate Biofuel. The larger variety of items used makes more Biofuel. 1 bucket of Biofuel generates 640,000 RF at 160 RF/t.

![Protein Generator](item:industrialforegoing:protein_generator)
The Protein Generator generates RF using Protein, which is made in the Protein Reactor. The Protein Reactor uses RF and animal matter to generate Protein. The larger variety of items used makes more Protein. 1 bucket of Protein generates 1,280,000 RF at 320 RF/t.
