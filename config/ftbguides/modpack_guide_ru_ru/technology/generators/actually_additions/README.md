# Actually Additions

These are all the generators added by Actually Additions.

![Solar Panel](item:actuallyadditions:block\_furnace\_solar)
Solar Panels generate 8 RF/t when it has direct sight to sunlight.

![Heat Collector](item:actuallyadditions:block\_heat\_collector)
Heat Collectors generate 40 RF/t when it is touching at least 4 Lava source blocks. It has a chance of destroying one of them every so often, however.

![Leaf-Eating Generator](item:actuallyadditions:block\_leaf\_generator)
The Leaf-Eating Generator breaks Leaves within 7 blocks of itself, generating 300 RF per block.

![Bio Reactor](item:actuallyadditions:block\_bio\_reactor)
The Bio Reactor generates RF from plant matter in its inventory. The larger variety of items, the more RF is generated.

![Oil Generator](item:actuallyadditions:block\_oil\_generator)
The Oil Generator can make RF from Canola Oil. There are several tiers of Oil you can use, which have a fairly complicated process to make. Click the page at the top to read more.
