# Canola Oil

First things first, you'll want to farm some Canola. You can use any farming blocks you want.

Next, put the Canola into a Canola Press to make Canola Oil. Canola Oil generates 80,000 RF at 40 RF/t, or you can continue processing the Oil to make it better.

Move the Canola Oil into a Fermenting Barrel (you can just put the Fermenting Barrel directly next to the Canola Press) and it will turn into Refined Canola Oil, which generates 192,000 RF at 80 RF/t.
![The Canola Press works faster than the Fermenting Barrel, so you may want to use multiple. If using Fluiducts, also use Filters to prevent the Refined Canola Oil from going through those pipes](fermenting.png)

Next, make some Crystallized Canola Seeds by putting regular Canola Seeds in front of an Atomic Reconstructor.

Drop this in a pool of Refined Canola Oil. In the picture, a Comparator is being used to check if the Fluid Placer has at least 1,000mB of Refined Canola Oil in it. If it does, it powers 2 Redstone Dust which are connected to one half of a vanilla Redstone AND gate. The other half is powered by a Hovering Hourglass with 4 sand in it, for 4 seconds. If both are on, it powers the Fluid Placer and the Automatic Precision Dropper, pauses, then powers the Fluid Collector.
![This is fairly complicated, so you can just try to copy the photo.](crystallized_oil.png)
Crystallized Oil generates 560,000 RF at 100 RF/t.

For the last steps, put a Crystallized Canola Seed on an Empowerer and surround it with 4 regular Canola Seeds. This will make an Empowered Canola Seed.

Drop this in a pool of Crystallized Canola Oil, the same way as the Refined Canola Oil.

Empowered Oil generates 960,000 RF at 120 RF/t.
