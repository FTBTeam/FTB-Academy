#Fluiducts

Fluiducts are used to transfer fluids.

Place a line of Fluiducts along the path you want it to move, starting at the source and ending at the destination. You can use the Crescent Hammer to sever unwanted connections. Place a Servo on the connection to the source.

By default, the Servo will only extract while given a Redstone signal, but you can set it to work always.

![Regular Fluiduct](item:thermaldynamics:duct_16 1 0)
Regular Fluiducts cannot transfer fluids that are too hot or too cold, and are fairly slow.
![Hardened Fluiduct](item:thermaldynamics:duct_16 1 2)
Hardened Fluiducts can transfer all fluids.
![Signalum-Plated Fluiduct](item:thermaldynamics:duct_16 1 4)
Signalum-Plated Fluiducts can carry all fluids, as well as transfer 4,000 RF/t per connection.
![Super-Laminar Fluiduct](item:thermaldynamics:duct_16 1 6)
Super-Laminar Fluiducts are one of the quickest way to transfer fluids. They work best when fluid is being pushed into it by the source rather than being pulled out with a Servo.
It takes a couple seconds to pressurize, but they will transfer at hundreds of buckets per second at max speed.

The Crescent Hammer acts as a wrench. It can rotate most blocks, sever Duct connections, and instantly break Ducts if sneak right clicked.
