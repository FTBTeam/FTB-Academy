# Energy Transfer

While you can technically get away with just having your generators directly next to your machines, that isn't a very good idea. These are all the ways to move RF from one place to another.

Fluxducts are cheap and easy. Just lay a path from the source to the destination, and power can go through them.

Energy Laser Relays are a bit more complicated. They transfer RF wirelessly and can be much faster than Fluxducts, but are harder to set up.

Energy Crystals are also wireless, and are by far the fastest way to transfer RF. They're also much more expensive, which means these will probably be fairly late-game.

Energy Tesslocators have multiple tiers. Advanced Energy Tesslocators are wireless and don't require connections or direct line of sight.
