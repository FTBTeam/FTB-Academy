To connect Laser Relays, right click on both of them with a Laser Wrench.

RF can come in and out of any Relay in the network. There is also a slight energy loss between the input and output of the network, so what you get out will be slightly less than what you put in. This is only between the inputs and outputs though, the amount of relays that only connect to other relays does not matter.

![Energy Laser Relay](item:actuallyadditions:block\_laser\_relay)
Basic Energy Laser Relays can transfer 1,000 RF/t.
![Advanced Energy Laser Relay](item:actuallyadditions:block\_laser\_relay\_advanced)
Advanced Energy Laser Relays can transfer 10,000 RF/t.
![Extreme Energy Laser Relay](item:actuallyadditions:block\_laser\_relay\_extreme)
Extreme Energy Laser Relays can transfer 100,000 RF/t.

If you have a lower tier Relay between two higher tier ones, the transfer rate of the lowest will be used.
