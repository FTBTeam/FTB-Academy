# Energy Crystals

Energy Crystals can wirelessly transfer RF.

You can connect Crystals using the Crystal Binder. Sneak right click the Crystal Binder on a Crystal to bind it to that Crystal, and then right click on all the other Crystals you want it to be connected to.

There are three tiers of Energy Crystal. Each tier increases the amount of RF they can store, as well as the amount of connections they can have. Even the basic Crystals can move at least 25,000 RF/t.

RF enters and exists the system through Energy I/O Crystals. By default they will pull from the block they are placed on. Sneak right click the I/O Crystal with an empty hand to set to output instead. I/O Crystals have the least number of possible connections.

Energy Relay Crystals have the highest amount of links, so they should be used to connect I/O Crystals.

Wireless Energy Crystals can transfer RF from the network to machines in the world. Use the Crystal Binder to connect it to the RF source (I/O or Relay Crystals) and then sneak right click on the machines you want to power. If energy can only be inserted on certain sides of a machine, bind it to that side.
