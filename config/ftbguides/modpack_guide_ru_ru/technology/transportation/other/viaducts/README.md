#Viaducts

Like other Ducts allow you to transfer items, energy, and fluids, Viaducts allow you to transfer yourself! Players move through Viaducts at 10 blocks per second.

Place a line of path of Viaducts along the route you want people to travel. Right click a Viaduct with a Crescent Hammer to open it, allowing players to enter and exit through it to/from other openings. 

Click on the opening and choose your destination to travel to it, so long as it's in the same Viaduct system.

Click the Config button in the GUI to change the name and icon for that opening.

Long Range Viaducts are twice as fast as regular Viaducts, which make them very good for movement over long distances.
You cannot open Long Range Viaducts, and you can't have intersections. Place a line with exactly two destinations, and place a Long Range Linking Viaduct on either end. Right click the Linking Viaducts to complete that segment.

Connect regular Viaducts to the Linking Viaducts, and they will function as expected. If you choose a destination on the other end of the Long Range Viaducts, you will be transported to the Linking Viaduct before going through them to the other end, and then from there you will be transported to your destination.
