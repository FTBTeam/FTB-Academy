To get there, make dig a 2x2 hole in the ground and fill it with Water. Surround it with flowers similar plants, and throw a Diamond in.

It would be a good idea to place a waypoint down at the portal with B.

The Twilight Forest has a progression system. That means that some biomes and structures will be completely blocked off until you defeat specific bosses.
