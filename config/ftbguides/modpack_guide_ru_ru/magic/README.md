#Magic
While tech mods usually go hand in hand with each other, being mostly combinable with each other, magic mods are much more standalone. They often have little to no interaction with each other, and almost always stay within a specific theme.

## Botania
Botania describes itself as "a tech mod themed around natural magic." It does all the things a tech mod usually does, except in the form of magical flowers.
![Lexica Botania](item:botania:lexicon)
The Lexica Botania is basically the best in-game documentation ever, and it's built in to the mod so we don't really need a page for it in the Guide. Read the Lexica Botania and follow the quests to learn more about the mod.

## Astral Sorcery
Astral Sorcery is a much more traditional magic mod, "focused around harnessing the powers of starlight and the constellations."
![Astral Tome](item:astralsorcery:itemjournal)
Like Botania, Astral Sorcery has a book that has all the information you need. Read the Astral Tome and follow the quests to learn more about the mod.

## Twilight Forest
Twilight Forest adds an entire new dimension, full of new animals, biomes, monsters, and bosses.

[Twilight Forest does not have an in-game guide, so we have a section in the Guide here that you can read for information, along with the quests.](guide:twilight_forest)
